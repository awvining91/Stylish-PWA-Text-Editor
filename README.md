Check out the power of partial web app! ðŸš€

This app allows you to use a text editor even if there is no internet connection.

## Description

This project features an amazing web editor that allows one to create and view code snippets. They can do so even without an internet connection!
Offline apps can be a real life saver for some people. 

The assignment features Cache APIs and integrated service workers and utilizes the latest tech trends with PWAs.

## Challenges

I had a number of bugs and things not working out the way I expected. I hard time at first understanding how partial web apps worked, and how to implemenent it into the challenge. I tried to push forward and do what I could.

PWAs seem really fun and interesting and I would like to learn more about them in the future. Currently work is crazy right now and with holiday stress, and jam-packed schedules I wasn't able to get as much done as I would have liked to but I learned a lot.

## Next Steps

I am trying to catch up on the homework assignments and haven't fully completed this one yet. I hope to come back to this one and finish it up. 

Next we are working on React which I am really excited for. We are really flying through content which is good and bad but I would like to continue learning more about React. 

## Progress Update

I worked on the TODOs on webpack.config.js, src-sw.js, install.js mostly. I have not finished the database.js. I plan on coming back and finishing up the project when I have more time. Project Three is looming ahead and I'm trying to catch up on homework.

Have a great day!!! :)
