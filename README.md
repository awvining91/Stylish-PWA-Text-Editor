# Check out the power of partial web app!

This app allows to use a text editor even if there is no internet connection.

## Challenges

I had a number of bugs and things not working out the way I expected. I hard time at first understanding how partial web apps worked, and how to implemenent it into the challenge. I tried to push forward and do what I could.

## Next Steps

I am trying to catch up on the homework assignments and haven't fully completed this one yet. I hope to come back to this one and finish it up.
